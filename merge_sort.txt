1. Start with a list of items. 
2. Take the length of the entire list and divide in half.
3. Divide each of the new lists in half until each element stands alone. 
4. Combine the individual elements in pairs, placing the smallest element first.
I.e. if there are 10 elements, look at elements 1 and 2. If element 2 = 10 and element 1 = 15, elements 1 and 2 switch place. 
Continue for all elements. 
We now have the entire list sorted in pairs. 
---Next we merge the first and second lists back together. 
6. Looking at the first element in each list, merge the lowest value from the two lists.
7. Restart the sequence and merge the lowest value from the two lists. Repeat until only one list of 4 items remains. Repeat for all lists.
8. Now there are lists of 4 items. Repeat the step above by comparing two lists of 4 items. Only looking at the smallest item in each list, compare and place the smallest of the two into a new list. Repeat this step until you have a list of 8 sorted items.
9. Repeat steps until entire list is sorted. 

With values:

Given an array [3,7,9,1,8,4,5,2,6]
1. [3,7,9,1,8][4,5,2,6]
2. [3,7,9][1,8][4,5][2,6]
3. [3,7][9][1,8][4,5][2,6]
4. [3,7,9] [1,4,5,8] [2,6]
5. [1,3,4,5,7,8][2,6]
6. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
